# Python Learning Repository

This repository serves as a collection of my daily/weekly Python projects, helping me enhance my Python skills and delve into various aspects of programming, data structures, and algorithms.

## Project Structure

- All projects are stored directly within the main repository folder.
- Each project has its own Python script (.py) and may include additional files or folders when needed.
- Follow a consistent naming convention for project scripts and provide meaningful comments/documentation within each script.

## Goals

- Improve Python programming proficiency.
- Explore data structures, algorithms, and software design concepts.
- Build a diverse portfolio of Python projects.

## Directory Structure

/PythonLearningProjects
|-- project_1.py
|-- project_2.py
|-- project_3.py
|-- ...

## How to Run

- Navigate to the main repository folder.
- Execute a specific project script using a Python interpreter, e.g., `python project_1.py`.
